    vendor's API, holding no labscript state and knowing nothing about shots.

    The worker calls `set_attributes`, `get_attributes_as_dict`, `snap`,
    `grab`, `grab_multiple`, `configure_acquisition`, `stop_acquisition`,
    `abort_acquisition` and `close`. `snap` is called with no acquisition
    configured and must arrange its own; `grab` is called only between
    `configure_acquisition` and `stop_acquisition`. An array returned by either
    must stay valid after the next one is taken, since `grab_multiple`
    accumulates them, which is why most cameras copy out of the vendor's
    buffer.

    Subclassing this is an offer, not a requirement -- the worker duck-types
    its camera -- but a camera that does subclass it gets `grab_multiple`,
    `abort_acquisition` and the composing `get_attributes_as_dict` for free and
