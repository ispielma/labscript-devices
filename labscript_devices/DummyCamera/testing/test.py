"""An absorption image with no hardware behind it.

Compile this from runmanager with globals named `atom_number` and
`cloud_radius`. The image function below uses them, so the images in the shot
file change when they do. BLACS then acquires those images the way it acquires
any camera's, and a lyse script reads them out of images/side/absorption the way
it reads any camera's.

The physics is all in `absorption_frame`, which is the point: the camera knows
only how to call a function on its own pixels and store what comes back.
