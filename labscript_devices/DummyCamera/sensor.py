"""A dummy camera's sensor: how big it is, and what its counts are stored as.

Both halves of the device need these. The labscript half evaluates image
functions on the grid while the shot compiles; the BLACS worker needs the same
size for a manual-mode frame, where there is no shot and so no image function.
Neither half can import the other's module -- one reaches labscript and through
it pylab, the other reaches blacs -- so they share this one, which needs neither.

Nothing here models anything. A camera returns counts; what those counts mean is
the user's image function's business, and a blank frame is what this module
offers when no function has said otherwise.
