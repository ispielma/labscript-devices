Dummy Camera
============

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A camera with no hardware behind it, whose images come from a function you
write. Each exposure names a function of the camera's pixels; the function is
evaluated while the shot compiles, where the shot's globals are in scope, and
the images it returns are stored in the shot file. BLACS then acquires them
through the path every camera's images take, so BLACS displays them and a lyse
script reads them exactly as it reads a real camera's.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

No installation and no hardware. Add it to a connection table as you would any
camera. It has no sensor to fall back on, so its :code:`camera_attributes` must
give it a :code:`Width` and a :code:`Height`: an image quietly the wrong size is
worse than one that does not compile.

Usage
~~~~~

An image function takes the camera's coordinate grid, then whatever else you
choose to pass it, and returns an array of counts of the same shape as the
grid. :code:`X` and :code:`Y` are in object-plane micrometres, scaled by the
camera's :code:`pixel_size` and :code:`magnification`, so a function describes a
cloud in microns rather than in pixels.

.. code-block:: python

    DummyCamera(
        'camera',
        camera_trigger,
        'trigger',
        orientation='side',
        trigger_duration=0.01,
        pixel_size=[5.2, 5.2],
        magnification=2.0,
        camera_attributes={'Width': 512, 'Height': 512, 'PixelFormat': 'Mono16'},
    )

    def absorption_frame(X, Y, atoms):
        """A probe beam, with a cloud absorbed out of it when atoms is True.

        `atom_number` and `cloud_radius` are globals of the shot. Nothing
        passes them in: they are in scope by the time this is called, because
        it is called while the shot compiles.
        """
        probe = 8000.0 * np.exp(-(X ** 2 + Y ** 2) / (2 * 400.0 ** 2))
        if not atoms:
            return probe
        peak_density = atom_number / (2 * np.pi * cloud_radius ** 2)
        column_density = peak_density * np.exp(
            -(X ** 2 + Y ** 2) / (2 * cloud_radius ** 2)
        )
        return probe * np.exp(-0.2907 * column_density)

    start()
    camera.expose(1.0, 'absorption', 'atoms', function=absorption_frame, atoms=True)
    camera.expose(1.1, 'absorption', 'probe', function=absorption_frame, atoms=False)
    camera.expose(1.2, 'absorption', 'dark', function=lambda X, Y: np.zeros(X.shape))
    stop(2)

The three frames of an absorption image come from one function called three
ways. Sharing the function is what makes them agree with each other: the probe
beam is identical in the atoms and probe frames, so an optical density computed
from them means something. A working version of this is in
:code:`labscript_devices/DummyCamera/testing/test.py`.

The function is called once per exposure as the shot compiles, and is never
stored anywhere -- only the images it returns are. So it can be any callable,
including a local function or a lambda, and the machine BLACS runs on does not
need it, even when the camera's worker is on another host.

An exposure given no function gets :obj:`~labscript_devices.DummyCamera.sensor.default_image`,
a plain dip in a flat background, so that a connection table with a dummy camera
in it compiles and runs before any model has been written. It is also what the
Snap button in the BLACS tab shows, where there is no shot and so no function.

Noise is the function's business: the camera adds none. What the camera does add
is a :code:`NOT_REAL_DATA` attribute beside the images in the shot file, which is
what marks them as simulated. It is an attribute rather than a watermark drawn
onto the pixels because a watermark does not cancel in
:code:`OD = -log((atoms - dark) / (probe - dark))`, and would ruin the analysis
this camera exists to feed.
